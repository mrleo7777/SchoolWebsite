      <h2>Welcome Parents</h2>
      <p>When parents send their children to The Summit, they have chosen to surround their children with a culture of excellence in a school that has a tradition of developing leaders of character. Expectations here are high as parents and faculty work in partnership to develop each child’s fullest potential spiritually, academically, physically, socially and artistically.
<br><br>
Summit parents have many opportunities to be involved in their children’s education in meaningful ways – at home, at school and in the Summit community.
<br><br>
Summit parents have access to a highly personalized online portal which gives them a comprehensive picture of each child’s school activities – grades, assignments, extracurricular activities, athletics and special events – as well as providing a convenient way to connect with teachers in order to help support their children’s academic activities at home.
<br><br>
The Summit Parents Association (SPA) has been devoted since its founding in 1923 to strengthening the community through social, spiritual and academic support. The SPA operates the Spirit Shop and Uniform Resale Shop; organizes room-parent volunteers at every grade level; sponsors community-building activities such as Fall Festival, Spring Dinner and other events; and helps staff the annual Love Your School Auction. The SPA is a non-dues paying organization. Every Summit family belongs to the SPA. Primary funding for annual programs comes from the Uniform Resale Shop, Kroger Community Rewards Program, Remke Market's Caring Neighbor Program and AmazonSmile. SPA dedicates its funds to programs that benefit students, parents, faculty and staff. For more information on SPA, contact SPA Parent Liaison Conky Greiwe or SPA president Meg Grulee.
<br><br>
The Summit Boosters Association is open to all Summit families. The Summit Boosters Association provides ongoing supplementary support for our sports teams, helps improve our athletic facilities and manages our K-6 sports program. Parents can participate as a board member, K-6 coach, team liaison or help at events. The group relies on membership fees and concession revenues as the main sources of funding. Several levels of membership are available as shown on this Booster Membership Form.
<br><br>
Parent Ambassadors work with the Admissions Office to help prospective parents understand The Summit and help acclimate new families to the school. These parents also are involved in the Parents Speakers Series, Early Childhood Education Symposium and other events.
<br><br>
To help meet the needs of busy working parents, The Summit offers many options for care and enrichment for children outside of the school day in Before School, After School and Holidays.
<br><br>
On our diverse campus, our families come from across the region and around the world. Global citizenship is part of our focus. Ex-patriot parents can reach out to our International Families. Families also have opportunities to host our growing population of international students sponsored by Westar Education.
<br><br>
Prospective parents who want more information about the school can request information online or call 871-4700 x261 to schedule a tour.</p>
