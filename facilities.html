<h2>Bringing Sportsmanship to Life</h2>
<p>As part of its promise to offer every student the opportunity to grow physically and practice good sportsmanship, The Summit provides student athletes with a full range of facilities and playing fields. The breadth of these resources allows us to offer students a three-season athletic schedule that fields 42 teams grades seven through twelve, and gives students multiple opportunities to develop their skills. Regular renovations and improvements to our fields and facilities speak not only to our commitment to athletics, but also to the significant role that sports play in nurturing a sense of school spirit. Our facilities are located on our Main Campus, 2161 Grandin Road, Cincinnati, OH 45208, and at our Athletic Complex, conveniently located off the Red Bank Road exit on Interstate 71 at 5580 Ehrling Road, Cincinnati, OH 45227. </p>

	<h3>Athletics Complex</h3>
	<p>Location: 5580 Ehrling Road, Cincinnati, OH</p>
	<p>Directions: Take I-71 to Red Bank Rd. exit. At light turn right onto Duck Creek. Turn right at the first street which is Old Red Bank. Go under the overpass and turn left onto Ehrling Road. Get driving directions from your location from this link at mapquest.com.</p>
	<p>The Athletic Complex is a 16-acre site which includes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A state-of-the-art baseball field.</li>
		<li>Five tennis courts.</li>
		<li>A natural turf softball field.</li>

	<h3>Baseball Field</h3>
	<p>The Motz Group of Newtown, Ohio, installed the Triple Play™ HP synthetic turf baseball system, making The Summit’s field a first-of-its kind model for baseball fields. The entire infield is covered with this improved high-performance artificial grass and advanced underlayment system. Among the benefits are a truer bounce of the ball and speeds close to the experience of a high performance natural turf field, cooler surface temperatures, and elimination of rain-outs due to poor field conditions.</p>
